# MovieStore

movie store app (frontend, backend) to store text data of the movies

I created this app in PyCharm. I was using tkinter for user interface, and sqlite3 or databases.
First i created frontend, user interface with tkinter, next step was backend where i was using sqlite3.
Then i had to connect frontend and backend.
Finnaly i created single windows executable file for running the app using pyinstaller.

FRONTEND

Using grid i created entry boxes for title, director, year and ISBN(random number that every movie has).
Then there are buttons:
View all - to view all list of the movies stored
Search - for searching specifing movie
Add entry - to add new movie
Update - if you would like to add changes to some movie
Delete - deleting some movie
Close - for exiting from app
List box with scrollbar. When you have bigger list of movies you can scroll trough it.

BACKEND

With sqlite3 i created database and conected buttons, entries and listbox with it.
